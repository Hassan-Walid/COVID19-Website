                    who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is
                    why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home

                    Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through

                    COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important
                    to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety.

                    their own mouth, nose,

                    available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.
                    Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. 
                    Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks.
                    However,
                    the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.

                    cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a 
                    distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing

                    The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, 
                        tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have 
                        aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore
                        throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild

                        develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people
                        (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing 
                        special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who 
                        gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing.

                        high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely

                    Thermal scanners are effective in detecting 
                    people who have developed a fever 
                    (i.e. have a higher than normal body temperature)
                    because of infection with the new coronavirus.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, they cannot detect people who 
                    are infected but are not yet sick with fever.
                    This is
                    because it takes between 2 and 10 days before 
                    people who are infected become sick and develop a fever.

                    Do vaccines against pneumonia protect you against the new coronavirus?

                 <div class="content_accordion" id="acc_6_8">
                    No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and 
                    Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide protection 
                    against the new coronavirus.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The virus is so new and different that it needs its own vaccine. 
                    Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV,
                    and WHO is supporting their efforts.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Although these vaccines are not effective against 2019-nCoV,
                    vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly recommended to protect your health.
